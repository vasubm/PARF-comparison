# PARF-comparison

This project aims to find the difference in throughput for different Rate Adaptation Algorithms for different WiFi standards like IEEE802.11n and ac.

Generated the plt plots by running the example programs in ns3 (wifi-rate-adaptation-distance.cc and wifi-power-adaptation-distance.cc).
Then converted it to eps plots using gnuplot

To generate the image for the eps plots, use load "filename" in gnuplot
